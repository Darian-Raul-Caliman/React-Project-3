ðŸ“… Date Stepper App
A simple React app that allows users to increment or decrement a day counter and step value, showing a future or past date accordingly.

ðŸš€ Features
Increase or decrease the step size by which days are added or subtracted.

Navigate forward or backward in time using the step value.

Displays the resulting date and how far it is from today.

ðŸ§  How It Works

step controls how many days are added or subtracted at once.

day represents the total number of days shifted from today.

The app calculates a new date using the current day + day.

Clicking the +/- buttons changes either the step value or the total day count.
